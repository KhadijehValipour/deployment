- [Illusion Diffusion](https://fal.ai/models/illusion-diffusion/api)

Illusion-diffusion is a term used in psychology to describe a phenomenon where a person's perception of an illusion is influenced by the presence of other people. In other words, when individuals view an illusion in a group setting, their perception of the illusion may be influenced by the reactions and interpretations of others around them. This can lead to a shared experience of the illusion that may differ from how an individual would perceive it in isolation.
